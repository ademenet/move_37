# Learn Reinforcement Learning

This repository aims to provide some exercises based on Siraj's curriculum about [reinforcement learning](https://www.theschool.ai/courses/move-37-course/). We will follow the same path but the approach is quite different because we will have a more practical approach to things.

## Requirements

### Knowledges

- Basic Python syntax knowledge.

### Environment

I recommand you to install Anaconda 3 and create your environment.

## Curriculum

### Week 1 - Markov Decision Processes

### Week 2 - Dynamic Programming

## Resources

- [RL book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1opPSz5AZ_kVa1uWOdOiveNiBFiEOHjkG/view) - [[site](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)] It is THE reference about RL. And it's free online!
